# Functions :-

# Functions are a block of code that are formed and used to execute
# an entire block of code again and again and especially anywhere.
# Two types of functions:
# 1. Built-in functions - Python provides it like sum(), type(), int().
# 2. User defined functions - You make it like fake_printer().
# Rule to name a function are similar to naming a variable.

# def fake_printer(a, b):
#     print("Hello World")
#     return a+b
#
# print(fake_printer(3, 4))

# def type_master(var):
#     return type(var)
#
#
# print(type_master("6"))

# pass can be used in for, while loops, if-else-elif ladder and functions
# to do nothing but execute and give no result.

def dogooder():
