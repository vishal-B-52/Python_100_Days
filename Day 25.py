# Tuple methods

# count() method returns the exact times the element has occurred in the tuple.
# tuplesh = (25, "tuples", "Lokesh", 3.226, 5, 'K', 15)
# print(tuplesh.count(5))

# index() method returns the index of first appearance of the element in the tuple.
# print(tuplesh.index(5))

# concatenating tuples - Concatenation yields a tuple where tuple2 elements are added to the end of tuple1 elements.
# This is a separate tuple that does not affect tuple1 and tuple2.
# conc = tups + tuplesh
# print(conc)
