# For loop

# For loops are useful if programmer wants to do same task repetitively
# Many loops in Python but use For loop if you are certain about the range.
# In short, good for definite range (Range that we know program can use to complete its goal).

# iterating over a string:
# for i in 'Vishal':
#     print(i, end='')
#     if i == 'h':
#         break

# iterating over a list, tuple, set
# for color in {'Red', 'Green', 'Blue'}:
#     print(color)

# Using range(start, stop, step[incr/decr]) function and increment:
# for i in range(1, 25, 3):  # 0 (by default) to end-1 (24) with a step of 3 will be printed
#    print(i, end=" ")

# for-else can be used if for doesn't execute and something else should
# execute instead of it.
# for i in range(23, 4):
#    print(i)
# else:
#    print("invalid range")
