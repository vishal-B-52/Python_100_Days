# While loop

# While loops are useful for iterating over indefinite range.
# While loops require a condition and loop variable which either increments or decrements.

# i = 0
# while i < 10:  # Prints from 0 to 9
#     print(i)
#     i += 1

# j = 10
# while j > 5:
#     print(j)
#     j -= 1

# While-else is used if the program control doesn't enter While loop
# and there has to be a condition which should execute for that.

# j = 10
# while j > 15:
#     print(j)
#     j -= 1
# else:
#     print("Loop didn't execute.")
